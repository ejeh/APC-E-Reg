                        <h3 class="card-text mb-3">RISKS</h3>
                        <p class="card-text mb-3">The trading of goods and products, real or virtual, as well as virtual currencies involves significant risk. Prices can and do fluctuate on any given day. Such price fluctuations may increase or decrease the value of your assets at any given moment. Any currency - virtual or not - may be subject to large swings in value and may even become worthless. There is an inherent risk that losses will occur as a result of buying, selling or trading anything on a market.</p>
                        <p class="card-text mb-3">Virtual Asset and Digital Asset trading also has special risks not generally shared with official currencies, goods or commodities in a market. Unlike most currencies, which are backed by governments or other legal entities, or by commodities such as gold or silver, Virtual Assets and Digital Assets are a unique type of asset, backed by technology and trust. There is no central bank that can issue more cryptocurrency or take corrective measures to protect the value of Virtual Assets and Digital Assets in a crisis.</p>
                        <p class="card-text mb-3">Instead, Virtual Assets and Digital Assets are an as-yet autonomous and largely unregulated global system of cryptocurrency firms and individuals. Traders put their trust in a digital, decentralised and partially anonymous system that relies on peer-to-peer networking and cryptography to maintain its integrity.</p>
                        <p class="card-text mb-3">The trading of Virtual Assets and Digital Assets is often susceptible to irrational (or rational) bubbles or loss of confidence, which could collapse demand relative to supply. For example, confidence in Virtual Assets and Digital Assets might collapse because of unexpected changes imposed by software developers or others, a government crackdown, the creation of superior competing alternative currencies, or a deflationary or inflationary spiral. Confidence might also collapse because of technical problems: if the anonymity of the system is compromised, if money is lost or stolen, or if hackers or governments are able to prevent any transactions from settling.</p>
                        <p class="card-text mb-3">There may be additional risks that we have not foreseen or identified in our Terms of Use.</p>
                        <p class="card-text mb-3">You should carefully assess whether your financial situation and tolerance for risk is suitable for buying, selling or trading Virtual Assets or Digital Assets.</p>
                        <p class="card-text mb-3">We use our banking providers in order to facilitate the receipt of fiat currency from Members and payments to other Members. Our banking providers DO NOT transfer, exchange or provide any services in connection with Virtual Assets or Digital Assets. Your fiat currency will be held in a bank account in the name of Coinit together with other Members' fiat currency. Where possible in a relevant jurisdiction which recognises the concept of a client account, we will notify the relevant banking provider that the bank account is a client account in which we hold fiat currency on behalf of Members. You will, in any event, remain the beneficial owner of the fiat currency that we hold on your behalf. We will maintain detailed records of all fiat currency held on behalf of Members. Whilst Coinit uses reasonable care in the appointment of its banking providers, in the event of a banking provider becoming insolvent or entering into an insolvency process in a relevant jurisdiction, Coinit may have only an unsecured claim against the banking provider, and Members' fiat currency balances may be at risk subject to any protections provided at law in the relevant jurisdiction.</p>
                        <p class="card-text mb-3">We engage with third-party custodians in order to hold Virtual Assets and Digital Assets on your behalf. Your Virtual Assets and Digital Assets will be held on your behalf in a wallet in the name of Coinit together with other Members' Virtual Assets and/or Digital Assets. They may also from time to time be held in the wallet together with Coinit's Virtual Assets and/or Digital Assets which reflect Coinit's fees, but which are recorded on Coinit's ledger as belonging to Coinit, and which you instruct Coinit to collect by withdrawing them from the wallet from time to time). We will maintain detailed records of all Virtual Assets and Digital Assets which Members hold with third-party custodians appointed by us.</p>
                        <p class="card-text mb-3">As set out below, Coinit will act only on your Instructions in respect of Virtual Assets and Digital Assets, and does not otherwise acquire any right, title or interest in them. Whilst Coinit uses reasonable care in the appointment of third-party custodians, in the event of a third-party custodian becoming insolvent or entering into an insolvency process in a relevant jurisdiction, you may have only an unsecured claim against the third-party custodian, and Members' Virtual Assets or Digital Assets may be at risk subject to any protections provided at law in the relevant jurisdiction.</p>

                        <p class="card-text mb-3">Coinit similarly reserves the right to freeze Ripple accounts in accordance with the Ripple Labs policy, which took effect on 15 September 2014. Please see the explanation provided by Ripple Labs below:</p>
                        <p class="card-text mb-3">"The freeze protocol extension gives gateways the ability to 1) globally freeze all their issued funds or 2) freeze funds issued to a specific user. Frozen funds may only be sent back to the issuing gateway. The global freeze feature allows a gateway to freeze all balances it issues. The gateway may still issue payments. Accounts holding frozen balances may return the funds to the gateway. This feature is useful for migrating users from one account to another and to safeguard users in the event that the gateway account is compromised. The individual freeze is primarily intended for compliance with regulatory requirements, which may vary from one jurisdiction to another. It also allows gateways to freeze individual accounts issuances in order to investigate suspicious activity. These features allow gateways to better operate in compliance with laws and regulations."</p>
                        <p class="card-text mb-3">You will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed, or that might reasonably be expected, to cause or result in destabilization or manipulation of the price of Virtual Assets or Digital Assets, which are available on the Site.</p>
                        <p class="card-text mb-3">Coinit reserves the right to suspend, delay or cancel an Instruction or series of Instructions issued by a Member or colluding Members which if executed would result in a price swing of 5% or more of the value of a cryptocurrency available on the Site.</p>
                        <p class="card-text mb-3">For the avoidance of doubt, any action taken by Coinit to suspend, delay, cancel or freeze any instructions and/or to suspend your Account will not affect your rights, title or interest in respect of your Virtual Assets and other Digital Assets which are held by a third-party custodian on your behalf, but may affect Coinit's ability to execute your Instructions, which you hereby acknowledge and agree.</p>
                        <p class="card-text mb-3">You acknowledge that you will only credit your Coinit account from a bank account that is in your own name and that you will instruct payments from your Coinit account only to a bank account that is in your own name.</p>

                        <h3 class="card-text mb-3">Wash Trading</h3>
                        <p class="card-text mb-3">Coinit does not allow you to cross trade, either alone or in collusion with others or to place an order, which would result in a self-execution - i.e., where the same trader or group of traders would act as both the maker and taker for the trade.</p>
                        <p class="card-text mb-3">If two orders of opposing sides would result in a crossed trade, both orders are subject to specific measures, ranging from scrutiny, cancellation, suspension or prohibition to trade on the Site. If two orders of the same quantity would result in self-execution, both orders are subject to specific measures, ranging from scrutiny, cancellation, suspension or prohibition to trade on the Site.</p>
                        <h3 class="card-text mb-3">Market Manipulation</h3>
                        <p class="card-text mb-3">You are prohibited from engaging or attempting to engage in market manipulation. This prohibition applies to any kind of activity that results in or has the purpose of:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><i class="fal fa-angle-right mr-2"></i>Artificially controlling or manipulating the price or trading volume of any of the virtual currencies listed on the Site; and</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p class="card-text mb-3">Market manipulation will trigger specific measures, ranging from scrutiny, cancellation of orders, suspension or prohibition to trade on the Site and disclosure to third parties including full disclosure to competent authorities.</p>
                        <p class="card-text mb-3">Lastly, you agree not to use the Services to perform criminal activity of any sort, including but not limited to, money laundering, illegal gambling operations, terrorist financing, malicious hacking or any criminal or illegal activity.</p>

                        <p class="card-text mb-3">The accounts that were or will be funded did not and will not earn interests.</p>
                        <h3 class="card-text mb-3">ARBITRAGING DIGITAL ASSETS</h3>
                        <p class="card-text mb-3">Coinit forbids individual accounts to perform digital asset arbitrage - i.e. depositing funds from third-party exchange service with only purpose to perform exchange and withdraw funds to a third-party exchange gaining profit on price differencies between Coinit and third-party exchange Services due to high possibility of money laundering activity. Coinit reserves the right to shut down that kind of activity by freezing arbitraged funds and forcing you to upgrade your account to Institutional. Coinit reserves the right to freeze your account untill you follow the conditions of this term. Individual account, upgraded to Institutional, or account registered as Institutional is exempted of following this requirement. Coinit will not charge you any fees for upgrading your account to Institutional while being frozen for performing this kind of activity.</p>
                        <h3 class="card-text mb-3">COMMISSIONS</h3>
                        <p class="card-text mb-3">Coinit Commissions are available in our Fee Schedule. Coinit reserves the right to change its Commissions at any time and at its sole discretion. You will be notified of any changes in advance through your Account or Email. Upon such notification, it is your responsibility to review the amended Fee Schedule. Your continued use of the Site following the posting of a notice of Commission changes signifies that you accept and agree to the changes. Coinit will not charge you any fees other than the Coinit Commissions and other fees set out in the Fee Schedule. Coinit may not use the Digital Assets and/or Virtual Assets in any way to generate revenue other than in connection with the charging of fees as set out in the Fee Schedule.</p>
                        <h3 class="card-text mb-3">VERIFICATION OF ACCOUNTS</h3>
                        <p class="card-text mb-3">The creation and use of your Account are subject to verifications, as required by statutory and regulatory obligations incumbent on Coinit. You agree to provide us with the information we request for the purposes of identity verification, compliance with know-your-customer rules, as well as detection of money laundering, terrorism financing, fraud or any other financial crime. The requested information may include Personal Data (please refer to our Privacy Policy ). </p>

                        <p class="card-text mb-3">By providing us with the information we request, you confirm Coinit exchange platform as made available on websites that it is true and accurate, and agree to inform us in case of change concerning such information. Your Account will be blocked until we are satisfied with the information you have provided and determine in our sole discretion that it is sufficient to validate your Account. In the meantime, you will not be allowed to terminate your Account or request the deletion of the Personal Data processed in the course of verification operations.</p>

                        <h3 class="card-text mb-3">TERMINATION AND ESCROW OF UNVERIFIED ACCOUNTS</h3>
                        <p class="card-text mb-3">You may terminate this agreement with Coinit and close your Account at any time, following settlement of any pending Transactions.</p>
                        <p class="card-text mb-3">You also agree that Coinit may, by giving notice, in its sole discretion terminate your access to the Site and to your Account, including without limitation, its right to: limit, suspend or terminate the Services and Members' Accounts, prohibit access to the Site, the Services and its content, services and tools, delay or remove hosted content, and take technical and legal steps to keep Members off the Site if we suspect that they are creating problems or possible legal liabilities, infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties, or acting inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms of Use. </p>
                        <p class="card-text mb-3">Additionally, we may, in appropriate circumstances and at our discretion, suspend or terminate Accounts of Members for any reason, including without limitation: (1) attempts to gain unauthorised access to the Site or another Member's account or providing assistance to others attempting to do so, (2) overcoming software security features limiting use of or protecting any content, (3) usage of the Services to perform illegal activities such as money laundering, illegal gambling operations, financing terrorism or other criminal activities, (4) violations of these Terms of Use, (5) a failure to pay or a fraudulent payment for Transactions, (6) unexpected operational difficulties, or (7) upon the request of law enforcement or other government agencies.</p>
                        <p class="card-text mb-3">Coinit expressly reserves the right to cancel and/or terminate Accounts that have not been verified by a Member despite efforts made in good faith by Coinit to contact said Member to obtain such verification ("Unverified Accounts''). All Unverified Accounts which have been inactive for a period of 6 months or more are further subject to transfer to a third-party escrow ("Unverified Escrow''), and will no longer be maintained or under the legal responsibility of Coinit. The administrator/trustee of the Unverified Escrow shall make any and all additional reasonable efforts required by law to determine and contact each Unverified Account owner and, after suitable effort and time has been expended, we may be required to convert the residual Virtual Assets or other Digital Assets into fiat and send the converted amount to a national authority responsible for the safekeeping of such funds.</p>
                        <p class="card-text mb-3">The suspension or escrow of an Account shall not affect the payment of commissions due for past Transactions. Upon termination, Members shall send to Coinit details of a valid bank account to allow for the transfer of any fiat currencies credited to their account. This bank account must be held by and in the name of the Member. Virtual Assets or other Digital Assets may be transferred to a valid bank account only after conversion into a fiat currency. Coinit shall facilitate the transfer of the currencies as soon as possible following the Member's request and within the time frames specified by Coinit.</p>
                        <p class="card-text mb-3">Coinit will arrange to send you the credit balance of your Account; however, in certain circumstances a number of intermediaries may be involved in an international payment and these or the beneficiary bank may deduct charges. We will make all reasonable efforts to ensure that such charges are disclosed to you prior to sending your payment; however, where they cannot be avoided, you acknowledge that these charges cannot always be calculated in advance, and that you agree to be responsible for such charges.</p>
                        <p class="card-text mb-3">Upon Account closure, any amount less than 25 USD/EUR in value will not be returned.</p>

                        <p class="card-text mb-3">By accepting the present Terms of Use, you acknowledge and accept the risk that underlying software protocols relating to any of the virtual currencies available on the Site are likely to be subject to sudden changes in operating rules (hereafter "fork"), and such forks may materially affect the value, function and/or the name of the virtual currencies that are exchanged or acquired through the Site.</p>
                        <p class="card-text mb-3">Coinit will use reasonable endeavours to provide you with notice of forks by publishing such a notice on the Site, including, to the extent possible, whether Coinit intends to support either or both branches of a fork, and you agree that you will read such notices in order to make a decision in that respect.</p>
                        <p class="card-text mb-3">However, it is your responsibility to make yourself aware of, and consider how to deal with, upcoming forks, including whether to give us Instructions for the withdrawal of the balance of any Virtual Assets or other Digital Assets. In the event of a fork, there is a risk that Coinit may need to temporarily suspend operations in relation to that fork without providing advance notice to you. Coinit may in their reasonable discretion, decline to support either or both branches of a fork.</p>
                        <p class="card-text mb-3">You acknowledge that third-party custodian-service providers may operate fork policies and, under their terms as entered into with you in respect of custodian services, may not be obliged (or able) to support all or any forks. You should ensure you check their fork policies regularly (as well as the terms of your agreement with custodian-service providers instructed by Coinit on your behalf, which will be made available to you) and whenever you become aware of a forthcoming fork. Notwithstanding that a third-party custodian-service provider may support a particular cryptocurrency, including a fork, this will not oblige Coinit to support that cryptocurrency or fork.</p>
                        <p class="card-text mb-3">In the event of a fork which affects Virtual Assets or other Digital Assets pursuant to these Terms of Use, and which is unsupported by Coinit:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><i class="fal fa-angle-right mr-2"></i>Coinit will not acquire any right, title or interest in the unsupported forked Virtual Asset and/or other Digital Assets; and</li>
                        <li class="card-text mb-3"><i class="fal fa-angle-right mr-2"></i>Coinit may be unable to give effect to any Instructions given in respect of those Virtual Assets or other Digital Assets and Coinit will have no liability to you in respect of the unsupported forked Virtual Assets or other Digital Assets.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="card-text mb-3">In the event that Coinit subsequently decides to support the forked Virtual Assets or other Digital Assets, Coinit will then give effect to your Instructions</p>
                        <p class="card-text mb-3">By agreeing to the present Terms of Use, you acknowledge the risks presented by forks and you accept that Coinit has no responsibility to assist you to move or sell Virtual Assets or other Digital Assets of an unsupported branch of a forked protocol.</p>
